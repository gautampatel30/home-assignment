## Project Overview

This project is designed as a simple coding assignment that consists of both a front-end (React-based) and a back-end (Node.js-based). Both parts must be run together to test the functionality of the system. Follow the above steps for installation and setup.

### Technology Stack:
- **Frontend:** React (with Vite for build and dev server)
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express

Make sure to read all instructions and complete the assignment before submitting the repository.

## Assignment Instructions

Your goal is to write a reusable, modular component that displays some data that is fetched from a server.

This `DisplayComponent` should have two variants, one that displays data horizontally, one that displays data vertically.

How you display the data is entirely up to you.

Please follow React best practices, use hooks where it makes sense, handle errors gracefully, comment liberally, etc.

Commits are free so commit early and often!
